Task 7 - Basic Sales Summary using SQLite and Python

Objective
To analyze basic sales data using SQL inside Python, and visualize the total revenue per product using a bar chart.

---

Tools Used
- **Google Colab** (for running Python code online)
- **SQLite3** (built-in lightweight database)
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

---

## ðŸ§± Steps Performed
1. **Created a SQLite database (`sales.db`)** directly in Colab using `sqlite3`.
2. **Added a `sales` table** containing product name, quantity, and price.
3. **Inserted sample data** for multiple products.
4. **Executed SQL queries** to calculate.
5. **Loaded query results into Pandas DataFrame.**
6. **Displayed results using `print()`** and visualized revenue by product using **Matplotlib bar chart**.
7. (Optional) **Saved chart as `sales_chart.png`.**

---

Output
- A table showing product-wise total quantity and revenue.
- A bar chart visualizing product revenue.

Learning Outcomes
- Learned to connect Python with SQLite using `sqlite3`
- Wrote and executed SQL queries inside Python
- Used Pandas for data manipulation
- Created and customized simple bar charts using Matplotlib
